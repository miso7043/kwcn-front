		conclusion: "Once you have a good understanding of your aptitudes and strengths, you need to think about how this relates to job searching in Canadian society. Your level of English proficiency, confidence, various support networks you have in Canada (information you know, ability to find necessary information, human resources, material, mental, etc.), level of understanding/unfamiliarity with Canadian society, Canadian labour market environment, etc., all have a significant impact on what kind of job you should target in Canada and what methods you should use for job searching."
